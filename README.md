# Mocap Drones

### A general purpose motion capture system built from the ground up, used to autonomously fly multiple drones indoors

## Dependencies
Install the pseyepy python library: [https://github.com/bensondaled/pseyepy](https://github.com/bensondaled/pseyepy)

This project requires the sfm (structure from motion) OpenCV module, which requires you to compile OpenCV from source. This is a bit of a pain, but these links should help you get started: [SFM dependencies](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/db/db8/tutorial_sfm_installation.html) [OpenCV module installation guide](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/blob/master/README.md)

`cv.sfm` is only used 3 times in the codebase for the following functions: `fundamentalFromProjections`, `essentialFromFundamental`, `motionFromEssential`. So really, those functions should just be reimplemented in Python so the sfm module isn't needed. [Issue](https://github.com/jyjblrd/Mocap-Drones/issues/4).

install npm and yarn

## Runing the code

From the computer_code directory Run `yarn install` to install node dependencies 

Then run `yarn run dev` to start the webserver. You will be given a url view the frontend interface.

In another terminal window, run `python3 api/index.py` to start the backend server. This is what receives the camera streams and does motion capture computations.

## Documentation
The documentation for this project is admittedly pretty lacking, if anyone would like to put type definitions in the Python code that would be amazing and probably go a long way to helping the readability of the code. Feel free to also use the [discussion](https://github.com/jyjblrd/Mocap-Drones/discussions) tab to ask questions.
